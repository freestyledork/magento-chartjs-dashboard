# magento-chartjs-dashboard
replaces the default image chart with chart js for better dependability
- tested on mage 1.9.4.1


# IMPORTANT
This module replaces default magento prototype js lib from 1.7.0 to 1.7.3. At the time of creating this I didn't see any issues, but there may be some lingering in the darkness. Use at your own risk.
